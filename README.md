# LED Color Management for a Board Game Table

this requires an LED strip and a sp108e LED controller. Warning, this is nothing more than a very quick hack.

Heavily based on the work of Hamish Coleman, https://github.com/hamishcoleman/led_sp108e

To use compile, then run: 

```
  go run main.go <options>
```

Can be used from the cli or as a rest service. Run with `-h` to see options.
